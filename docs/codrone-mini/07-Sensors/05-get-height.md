##### Syntax
```get_height()```

##### Parameters

None

##### Returns

The current height calculated by the difference between the current and the floor altitude(cm).

##### Example Code
###### Python
```python
#Python code
import CoDrone_mini

drone = CoDrone_mini.CoDrone()
drone.pair()

drone.takeoff()
drone.hover(3)
height = drone.get_height()
print(height)
drone.land()
```
