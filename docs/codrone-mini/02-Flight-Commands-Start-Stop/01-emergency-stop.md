##### Description

This function immediately stops all commands and motors, so the drone will stop flying immediately. The function will also reset the flight motion variables to 0. **NOTE:** If you want to take off and emergency stop, it is recommended to run a ```hover()``` or ```time.sleep()``` in between the ```takeoff()``` and ```emergency_stop()```, because the CoDrone Mini might miss the emergency_stop() command.


##### Syntax
Python: ```emergency_stop()```

##### Parameters

None

##### Returns

None

##### Example Code
