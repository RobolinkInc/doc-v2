##### Description

A simpler Junior level function that represents flight with direction with more natural language.
It simply flies in the given direction for a given duration and power.

##### Syntax

```go(direction)```<br />
```go(direction, duration)```<br />
```go(direction, duration, power)```

##### Parameters

**direction**: an enum in Python. Itâ€™s the direction of the flight, which can be one of the following: FORWARD, BACKWARD, LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN.<br />
**duration**: the duration of the flight motion in seconds. If undefined, defaults to run indefinitely.<br />
**power**: the power at which the drone flies forward. Takes a value from 0 to 100. Defaults to 50 if not defined.

##### Returns

None

##### Example Code
###### Python
```python
#Python code
import CoDrone_mini
from CoDrone_mini import Direction

drone = CoDrone_mini.CoDrone()
drone.pair()
drone.takeoff()

# Try each of these commands by uncommenting them
#drone.go(Direction.FORWARD) 		# Go forward indefinitely at 50% power
#drone.go(Direction.UP, 2) 			# Go up for 5 seconds at 50% power
drone.go(Direction.BACKWARD, 3, 40) # Go backwards for 3 seconds at 70% power
drone.land()
```
