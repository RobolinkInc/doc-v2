**CoDrone Version 1.4.3**

Additional Battle Functions<br />
CrashedCustom(boolean custom);<br />
Set to true to enable custom ‘out of hp/crash’ flag<br />
If set to true, there will be no death animation for the CoDrone when out of HP<br />
Instead, the check CrashedCheck() return at 1 when the CoDrone is out of HP<br />
Use this to create your own battle death maneuver “if (CrashedCheck()){ Custom maneuver}<br />

boolean CrashedCheck();<br />
Returns True if the CoDrone is out of HP<br />
Returns False if the CoDrone still has HP<br />
Must set CrashedCustom(true) before using CrashedCheck();<br />

BattleHitPoints(int points);<br />
Sets max hit points to “points”<br />
range from 1-8<br />
default is 8 hit points

Updated some timing functions to address the CoDrone disconnecting issue<br />
Added CheckTime1(), CheckTime2(), and CheckTime3()<br />
CheckTime1() is now a dedicated time check function for battle functions<br />
CheckTime2() is now a dedicated time check function for LED functions<br />
CheckTime() is now a dedicated time check function for Control functions<br />
CheckTime3() is not yet used

Changed SEND_CHECK_TIME to 10 (was 3)<br />
Set BATTLE_CHECK_TIME to 100<br />
Set LED_CHECK_TIME to 60

Updated Trim range descriptions<br />
The range for valid trim values is now properly represented as -500 to 500 (used to say -100 to 100).

Updated Examples<br />
Examples have been updated to match new functions
