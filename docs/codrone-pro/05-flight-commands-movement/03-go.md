# go()

##### Description

A simpler Junior level function that represents positive flight with a direction, but with more natural language. <br />
It simply flies in the given direction for the given duration and power.

##### Syntax

```go(direction)```<br />
```go(direction, duration)```<br />
```go(direction, duration, power)```

##### Parameters

**direction**:	a constant in Arduino and enum in Python. Itâ€™s the direction of the flight, which can be one of the following: FORWARD, BACKWARD, LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN.<br />
**duration**:	the duration of the flight motion in seconds. If undefined, defaults to 1 seconds. If duration is 0, it will turn right indefinitely.<br />
**power**:		the power at which the drone flies forward. Takes a value from 0 to 100. Defaults to 50 if not defined.

##### Returns

None

##### Example Code
###### Python
```python
#Python code
import CoDrone
from CoDrone import Direction

def main():	
	drone = CoDrone.CoDrone()
	drone.pair()
	drone.takeoff()
	
	drone.go(Direction.FORWARD) 		# Go forward for 1 second at 50% power
	drone.go(Direction.UP, 5) 			# Go up for 5 seconds at 50% power
	drone.go(Direction.BACKWARD, 3, 70) # Go backwards for 3 seconds at 70% power
	
if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()


```
###### Arduino
```c
//Arduino code
#include<CoDrone.h>		//header

void setup(){
	//open serial and connect
	CoDrone.begin(115200);
	CoDrone.pair(Nearest);

	CoDrone.takeoff();
	CoDrone.go(FORWARD); 		// Go forward at 50% power for 1 second
	CoDrone.go(UP, 5); 			// Go up for 5 seconds at 50% power
	CoDrone.go(BACKWARD, 3, 70) // Go backwards for 3 seconds at 70% power	
}

void loop(){

}
