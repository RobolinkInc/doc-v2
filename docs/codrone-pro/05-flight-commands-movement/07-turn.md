# turn()

##### Description

A function that represents yaw, but with more natural language. It simply turns in the given direction, duration and power.

##### Syntax
```turn(direction)```<br />
```turn(direction, duration)```<br />
```turn(direction, duration, power)```

##### Parameters

**direction**	: a constant in Arduino and enum in Python. Itâ€™s the direction of the turn, which can be one of the following: LEFT or RIGHT.<br />
**duration**	: the duration of the turn in seconds. If 0, it will turn right indefinitely. Defaults to 1 second if not defined.<br />
**power**		: the power at which the drone turns right. Takes a value from 0 to 100. Defaults to 50 if not defined.

##### Returns

None

##### Example Code
###### Python
```python
#Python code
import CoDrone
from CoDrone import Direction

def main():
	drone = CoDrone.CoDrone()
	drone.pair()
	drone.takeoff()
	
	drone.turn(Direction.LEFT)  		# Turn left for 1 second at -50 power
	drone.turn(Direction.LEFT, 0)  		# Turn left at -50 power indefinitely
	drone.turn(Direction.RIGHT, 3, 100) # Turn right for 3 seconds at 100 power
	
if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()


```
###### Arduino
```c
//Arduino code
#include<CoDrone.h>		//header

void setup(){
	//open serial and connect
	CoDrone.begin(115200);
	CoDrone.pair(Nearest);

	CoDrone.takeoff();
	CoDrone.turn(LEFT);  			// Turn left for 1 second at 50 power
	CoDrone.turn(LEFT, 0);			// Turn left at 50 power indefinitely
	CoDrone.turn(RIGHT, 5, 100); 	// Turn right for 5 seconds at 100 power	
}

void loop(){

}
```
